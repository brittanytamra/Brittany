# Hi I'm Brittany!

I'm an aspiring with  a Business Administration Diploma from George Brown College. I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I’m looking forward to gaining a stronger understanding of these languages by continuing my online learning and expanding into other languages. With my passion, hard work and drive, I’m excited  to land my next role as a Developer.
